I think if GitHub were to try to solicit sponsorships more aggressively that would just turn people off.    If there were a way to publicize the fact that these sponsorships exist without going as far as to suggest to a user that they go ahead and sponsor someone..maybe that would help.    I really don't know how this would be done... the goals of not turning people off and publicizing the idea more are in direct conflict.   I'm not sure it would look good either, if say your icon or profile picture looked differently when browsing a repo.   That might look like ""this person is paying to have their PRs treated with priority""... which might not be awful but I'm not sure that's what should be done here.

Maybe somehow people could write a few short posts: ""why I sponsored user XYZ"" and GitHub  could show a link and leave it for people to figure out the rest?"
