I can recommend it as it's tightly coupled with GitHub, the platform on which one most likely already hosts these open-source projects. In my GitHub sponsors profile I give a few benefits to sponsors such as priority bug fixes/feature requests as well as early release builds for some of my projects. I think these are great incentives to get other people to start sponsoring you. I do think advertising your sponsorship is quite important, as I've not had much success yet with them (as I simply do not advertise them).

I would also personally advise against excessively plugging your sponsorships in your project as I find that a bit annoying - it's almost like you're begging for money. You shouldn't make people feel obliged to sponsor you, after all that's not the essence of open-source. It is infinitely more valuable to make a great project that has lots of traction; if you just add sponsorship links to the repo, the financial support will come naturally. You should also not limit yourself to just GitHub Sponsors, try out things like Ko-fi, Open Collective, or even Tidelift."
